Is it on Spotify? Find out with this small webapp!

## Preparation
You'll need `npm`, `bower`, and `grunt`. Download dependencies with `npm install` and then `bower install`. Then run `grunt` to compile source files, copy files over to the public directory, and listen for changes to source files. 

## Launch
Run `node src/index.js` to host the app on `http://localhost:8080`.
